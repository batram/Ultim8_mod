fixed up in Loader.cs:

  class GameSettings
    int MaxPlayers = 4;
    PlayerColors                                      Random generate colors for new players

  class PlayerManager                                 maybe not needed if GameSettings.GetInstance().MaxPlayers is correct from the start                          
    maxPlayers
    playerList

  class LobbyManager
    lobbySlots
  
  class StatTracker
    saveStatuses
    saveFiles
  
  class NetworkLobbyManager
    m_MaxPlayers = 4;                                 ??? not patched yet ...
